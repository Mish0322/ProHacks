Our website:
The users of this website are targeted towards dementia patients. Dementia is a condition common to the elderly. It includes a decline in memory, language, problem-solving, and other essential skills which impact a personâ€™s daily activities. This website contains 2 main features: a game to improve cognitive memory skills, and a to-do list to help patients keep track of daily tasks. Additionally, it is important to support those diagnosed with dementia with positive information, so an uplifting message will be frequently updated on the home page!
